## Installation

### By CocoaPods

You can use Rescue SDK via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Add the following lines to your `Podfile`:

#### Podfile

```ruby
pod 'RescueSDK', '~> 1.0'
```

~~**Important:** don't forget to add both pod sources to top of your `Podfile`!~~

**UPDATE:** our pod has been moved to the official CocoaPods pod source. Please remove the LogmeinRescue `source` from your `Podfile`.

### Manually

Follow the guide on our [website](http://secure.logmeinrescue.com/welcome/webhelp/EN/SDKi/MobileSDK/c_riossdk_overview.html).
